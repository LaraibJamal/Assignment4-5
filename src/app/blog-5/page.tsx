          As we approach the end of 2024, GenAI development has made significant strides since the initial hype. Tech giants are not only delivering top-tier AI experiences but also easing the development process for creators. At OpenAI's Developer Day in October 2024, major announcements like the Real-Time Voice API and function calling capabilities brought us closer to building AI companions reminiscent of sci-fi movies (you will understand in a sec). While debates about AI's impact on jobs continue, it's clear that developing generative AI applications is becoming a rapidly growing career path.

AI engineering has become a niche on its own, with major tech companies offering their LLMs and SLMs as services, both open-source and proprietary. Businesses are seeking individuals who can leverage these models to maximize their value and create exceptional user experiences.

In this post, I’ll walk you through various use cases of generative AI. We’ll explore what generative AI can do across different industries, highlighting practical applications that demonstrate its value and potential impact..

Common Use Cases of Generative AI
It's worth mentioning that nearly every company, not just tech startups, can benefit from products and experiences crafted by Generative AI. In fact, AI engineers might make a lot of money working at companies where AI was not the center of focus before and are sitting on a heap of enterprise data.
